# grizzclayceramics
A personal website for my uncle and his amazing creations! Currently waiting on better/more pictures to update the site. 
Will consider a remake (it was made about two years ago with basic HTML/CSS) with React. 
To see the site in action, visit:

This repo is currently a dump of all the project files in a single-level repo.
